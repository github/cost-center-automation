# Teams Integration Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

We have successfully implemented a comprehensive **GitHub Teams Integration** module for the cost center automation utility. This module provides an alternative way to assign users to cost centers based on their GitHub team membership.

## Key Features

### 1. Dual Mode Support
- **Auto Mode**: Automatically creates one cost center per team
- **Manual Mode**: Allows explicit team-to-cost-center mappings via configuration

### 2. Multi-Organization Support
- Process teams from multiple GitHub organizations in a single run
- Configure multiple organizations in `config.yaml`

### 3. Single Cost Center Assignment
- **Each user can only belong to ONE cost center** (GitHub API constraint)
- Users in multiple teams are assigned to the LAST team's cost center processed
- Previous assignments are overwritten (not additive)
- Logs warnings for multi-team users showing final assignment

### 4. Automatic Cost Center Creation
- Optionally auto-create cost centers based on team names
- Customizable naming templates with variables: `{team_name}`, `{team_slug}`, `{org}`
- Default template: `"Team: {team_name}"`

### 5. Independent from PRU Mode
- Teams mode is completely independent from PRU-based mode
- Use `--teams-mode` flag to enable
- Cannot run both modes simultaneously (by design)

## Configuration Schema

### Teams Configuration (config.yaml)
```yaml
teams:
  enabled: false                    # Enable teams mode
  mode: "auto"                      # "auto" or "manual"
  organizations: []                 # List of GitHub orgs
  auto_create_cost_centers: true    # Auto-create cost centers
  cost_center_name_template: "Team: {team_name}"  # Naming template
  team_mappings: {}                 # Manual mappings (manual mode only)
```

## API Integration

### GitHub API Endpoints Used
1. **`GET /orgs/{org}/teams`** - List all teams in organization
2. **`GET /orgs/{org}/teams/{team_slug}/members`** - Get team members
3. **`POST /enterprises/{enterprise}/settings/billing/cost-centers`** - Create cost center
4. **`POST /enterprises/{enterprise}/settings/billing/cost-centers/{id}/resource`** - Add users

### Required Token Scopes
- `manage_billing:enterprise` - Manage cost centers (already required)
- `read:org` - Read team information (NEW requirement for teams mode)

## Usage Examples

### Basic Commands
```bash
# Show teams configuration
python main.py --teams-mode --show-config

# Plan (dry run)
python main.py --teams-mode --assign-cost-centers --mode plan

# Apply with confirmation
python main.py --teams-mode --assign-cost-centers --mode apply

# Apply without confirmation (automation)
python main.py --teams-mode --assign-cost-centers --mode apply --yes

# Generate summary
python main.py --teams-mode --summary-report
```

### Configuration Examples

**Auto Mode:**
```yaml
teams:
  enabled: true
  mode: "auto"
  organizations: ["my-org"]
  auto_create_cost_centers: true
  cost_center_name_template: "Team: {team_name}"
```

**Manual Mode:**
```yaml
teams:
  enabled: true
  mode: "manual"
  organizations: ["my-org"]
  team_mappings:
    "my-org/frontend": "Engineering: Frontend"
    "my-org/backend": "Engineering: Backend"
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture
- Teams mode runs as an **alternative flow** in `main.py`
- Separate manager class (`TeamsCostCenterManager`) handles all teams logic
- Reuses existing `GitHubCopilotManager` for API calls
- Follows same patterns as PRU mode (plan/apply, validation, confirmation)

### Key Classes and Methods

#### `TeamsCostCenterManager`
- `fetch_all_teams()` - Fetch teams from all configured organizations
- `fetch_team_members()` - Get members for a specific team
- `get_cost_center_for_team()` - Determine cost center for a team
- `build_team_assignments()` - Build complete assignment map
- `ensure_cost_centers_exist()` - Create cost centers if needed
- `sync_team_assignments()` - Sync assignments to GitHub Enterprise
- `generate_summary()` - Generate summary report

#### Enhanced `GitHubCopilotManager`
- `list_org_teams(org)` - List all teams in organization
- `get_team_members(org, team_slug)` - Get members of a team

### Error Handling
- Validates organizations are configured before execution
- Handles API errors gracefully (logs warnings, continues)
- Validates team mappings in manual mode
- Provides clear error messages for configuration issues

### Logging
- Comprehensive logging at all levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
- Tracks multi-team users
- Reports success/failure rates for assignments
- Summary statistics after execution

## Testing Performed

1. **Syntax Validation**: All Python files validated successfully
2. **Help Command**: Verified `--teams-mode` flag appears in help
3. **Configuration Loading**: Confirmed teams config is loaded correctly
4. **Validation Logic**: Tested that missing organizations trigger appropriate error

## Questions Answered

All user requirements were addressed:

1. ✅ **Mode Selection**: Both auto and manual modes supported
2. ✅ **Organization Selection**: Multiple organizations supported
3. ✅ **Team Filtering**: In manual mode, only mapped teams processed
4. ✅ **Single Cost Center Constraint**: Users can only belong to ONE cost center; multi-team users get last team's cost center
5. ✅ **Alternative Mode**: Completely independent from PRU mode
6. ✅ **Configuration Approach**: Hybrid - auto-create with manual overrides
7. ✅ **API Endpoints**: Identified and implemented
8. ✅ **Token Permissions**: Documented requirements

## What Users Can Do Now

Users can now:
1. Sync cost centers with GitHub team structure automatically
2. Choose between auto-creation or manual mapping of teams to cost centers
3. Process teams from multiple organizations
4. Handle users with membership in multiple teams appropriately
5. Run in plan mode to preview changes before applying
6. Automate team-based cost center sync with cron jobs or GitHub Actions
7. Generate summary reports of team-based cost center assignments

## Next Steps for Users

To use the teams integration:

1. **Update token permissions**: Ensure token has `read:org` scope
2. **Configure organizations**: Add organizations to `config.teams.organizations`
3. **Choose mode**: Set `teams.mode` to "auto" or "manual"
4. **Test with plan mode**: Run `--teams-mode --assign-cost-centers --mode plan`
5. **Apply assignments**: Run with `--mode apply` when ready
6. **Automate**: Set up cron job or GitHub Action for regular sync

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

When additional GitHub APIs become available:

1. **Cost Center Membership API**: 
   - Check existing cost center membership before assignment
   - Option to respect or overwrite existing assignments
   - Implement removal of users from cost centers

2. **Incremental Team Sync**:
   - Only process changed teams (similar to existing `--incremental` for users)
   - Track team membership changes since last run

3. **Team Hierarchy**:
   - Support parent/child team relationships
   - Nested cost center structures

4. **Advanced Filtering**:
   - Team name pattern matching (e.g., only teams with "copilot-" prefix)
   - Exclude specific teams
   - Include/exclude based on team properties
